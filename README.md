This is a purposefully poorly designed program for entertaintment purposes to learn about "importance of good coding practices".
The rules that were broken are:
i) Good variables names
ii) Design before you code
iii) Not enough functyions
iv) Not scalable
v) Unncecessary complexity
vi) Good comments
vii) Hidden costs
viii) Variables Proximity
ix) Literals over constants
x) Make loop conditions make sense!!!!
xi) Consistent style (haha this one is bad)
xii) Using whitespace (who is she?)
xiii) Readable code (Can you read?)
xiv) Putting the expected values first in conditionals 
xv) Defensive Programming (what is that?)
